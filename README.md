# AuctionSim
Auction Simulator that mimicks and online auctioning application, that allows users to login as a particular user type, and perform certain actions depending on their set of permissions. Developed in a group of 3 and the work was split into 6 phases. Weekly meetings were held to discuss what was successful from last week and where to improve, goals for the current week and how to acheive them.

#### Phase 1 - Requirements Gathering
In this phase, we gathered the software requirements from the stakeholders, and end-users. We defined the scope, features, and functionality of the software. We also defined the feasability; what the joint abilites of our team memebers were and if the application could be finished in the requested time, and how it could be acheived. 

#### Phase 2 - Design
UML designs were developed to define the software's structure and how its components will interact. White box testing was completed in this phase, developing a list of user inputs and expected outputs. 

#### Phase 3 - Coding
This is the phase where we wrote the actual code for the software based on the design specifications. We made sure to follow coding standards, and best practices. We divided the tasks and shared code via GitHub, creating branches and mergining to main when we know there is no conflicts. We also utilized Visual Studio Code's CodeTogether feature to do Pair Programming.

#### Phase 4 - Testing
This is the part of the development cycle where we tested features of the code. Pytest was used to compare the actual results with the expected results to ensure our code was working as intented. Unit testing was done for individual features and branch coverage testing was done to ensure each possible outcome was accounted for. 

#### Phase 5 - Depolyment
Once all testing was successfully completed, we deployed to the production environment for end-users. Acceptance testing was completed in this phase to ensure user's are able to use the simulator as originally requested.

#### Phase 6 - Maintenance
We made sure there was no bugs in the application, and fixed the code accordingly. We also updated the application according to the stakeholder's new requests. Regression testing was completed to ensure the new features did not affect existing features.
